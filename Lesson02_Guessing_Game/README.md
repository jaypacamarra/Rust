# Lesson 02 Guessing Game
A command line guessing game where the user enters their guess
and the program checks if it is correct!

Concepts applied:
- program entry point `fn main() {}`
- importing standard library with `use`
- print macro `println!`
- printing with placeholders `println!("some value {}", value)`
- mutable and immutable variables `let mut bananas`,`let apples`
- user input for stdin `io::stdin`
- comments `//`
- assocuated functions with `::`
- Handling potential failure
- random create `rand`
- Cargo.lock file for reproducible builds (usually checked into git)
- ranged expressions
- match expressions
- Ordering library `std::cmp::Ordering`
- Shadowing which allows use to reuse a variable name
